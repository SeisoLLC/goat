# GOAT Development Notes

## Environment Setup

Ensure you have `docker` and `pipenv` installed locally, and the `docker` daemon is running.
Then run the following command to install the dependencies onto your local system:

```bash
pipenv install --deploy --ignore-pipfile --dev
```

## Running the goat against the goat project locally

There are two ways of running the `goat` locally:

1. To see how it will look in a pipeline:

    ```bash
    pipenv run invoke goat
    ```

    Or add `--debug` for more information.

2. For speed during development, `docker` caching can be helpful:

    ```bash
    docker build .
    docker run -v $PWD:/goat/ -e PIPENV_PIPFILE="/etc/opt/goat/Pipfile" --rm <first several character of the hash output from the build step>
    ```

3. To pass in custom configs for individual linters or to exclude files with regular expressions, set environment variables:

    ```bash
    docker run -e INPUT_EXCLUDE='.*\.json$' -e BLACK_CONFIG='--required-version 21.9b0' -v $PWD:/goat/ --rm <hash>

    Note: Linter env variables must be formatted as <LINTER_CONFIG>, i.e. RUFF_CONFIG, CFN_LINT_CONFIG,
    etc., and the values supplied will overwrite the default arguments supplied in the goat.

4. Environment variables
   1. `-e PIPENV_PIPFILE="/etc/opt/goat/Pipfile"` is necessary when running the goat against repositories with their own  
   Pipfiles to ensure the goat's internal pipenv loads with the correct packages.
   2. `-e VALIDATE_PYTHON_MYPY="false"` disables the mypy linter. When this ENV is set, the goat will display output noting  
   mypy was skipped.

### Note

If adding linters to `linters.json`, the `executor` is an optional member of the linter object.
